## 📖 Overview

This project consists of a high-performance backend and a modern reactive frontend to calculate, store, and stream Fibonacci numbers. It leverages modern communication protocols like **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** and **WebSockets (STOMP)** to provide real-time updates to the client.

## 🏗 Project Structure

- **[`java-spring/`](./java-spring/)**: The backend built with Java 25 and Spring Boot. It handles computation, database persistence, and streaming.
- **[`client/`](./client/)**: The frontend built with Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a real-time dashboard for the Fibonacci sequences.
- **[`http/`](./http/)**: Utility scripts and HTTP files for testing the backend API without a browser.

## 🧬 Fibonacci Mathematics

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by:

$F_0 = 0$  
$F_1 = 1$  
$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n > 1$

The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

### Computational Approaches

1. **Fast Doubling**: $O(\log n)$ - Optimized for very large indices.
2. **Iterative**: $O(n)$ - Reliable linear approach.
3. **Recursive**: $O(2^n)$ - Standard recursive approach (use with caution).

## 🛠 Tech Highlights

- **Backend**: Java 25 Virtual Threads (Loom), Spring Boot 4, PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY`.
- **Frontend**: Astro 5, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, DaisyUI.
- **Streaming**: SSE for one-way updates, WebSockets for bi-directional interaction.
