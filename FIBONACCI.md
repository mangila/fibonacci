# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting
with 0 and 1.

## Mathematical Definition

The Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ are defined by the recurrence relation:

$F_0 = 0$
$F_1 = 1$
$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n > 1$

The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

- **Nature**: Fibonacci numbers often appear in biological settings, such as the branching of trees, the arrangement of
  leaves on a stem, and the fruit sprouts of a pineapple.

## Computational Approaches to Fibonacci

Three common computational approaches to calculating Fibonacci numbers are:

- Naive recursive
- "Normal" iterative
- "Normal" iterative with memoization
- Fast doubling algorithm
