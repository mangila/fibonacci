# 🛠 HTTP Utilities

> Autogenerated by Junie

This directory contains utility scripts and files for testing the Fibonacci backend API directly, bypassing the frontend.

## 📄 Files

### `query.http`
A standard `.http` file compatible with IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code (REST Client extension), and other HTTP clients. Use it to quickly test SSE query endpoints.

- **POST /list**: Queries a range of Fibonacci numbers.
- **GET /id**: Queries a specific Fibonacci number by its ID.

### `h2c.sh`
A bash script that uses `curl` to demonstrate an **H2C (HTTP/2 without TLS)** connection to the Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream.

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x h2c.sh
./h2c.sh
```

## 🧪 Testing Tips

- Ensure the backend is running at `http://localhost:8080`.
- The `streamKey` parameter is required for SSE endpoints to identify the session.
- For SSE, the `curl` command uses `-N` (no-buffer) to see events in real-time.
