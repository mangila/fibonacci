# 🛠 HTTP Utilities & API Testing

> [!NOTE]

This directory contains essential tools for testing the Fibonacci backend API directly. It is designed for developers who want to interact with the system via the command line or an integrated HTTP client.

## 📄 Core Files

### 1. `query.http`
A comprehensive collection of REST API requests.

**Available Operations:**
- `POST /api/v1/scheduler`: Request a new Fibonacci calculation.
- `GET /api/v1/sse/{channel}`: Subscribe to SSE stream.
- `POST /api/v1/sse/{channel}/list`: Query list via SSE.
- `GET /api/v1/sse/{channel}/id`: Query by ID via SSE.

### 2. `h2c.sh`
A utility script to demonstrate and test **H2C (HTTP/2 Cleartext)** streaming. This is particularly useful for validating Server-Sent Events (SSE) over a high-performance connection.

**How to use:**
1. Ensure the backend is running (`localhost:8080`).
2. Give the script execution permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x h2c.sh
   ```
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   ./h2c.sh
   ```

## 🧪 Expert Testing Tips

### Testing SSE with `curl`
To observe the real-time stream via `curl`, use the `--no-buffer` (`-N`) flag. This prevents `curl` from buffering the output, allowing you to see events as they arrive:

```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sse/livestream?streamKey=test-session"
```

### The `streamKey` Parameter
Most streaming endpoints require a `streamKey`. This is a unique identifier (typically a UUID in production) used by the backend to manage your SSE session and heartbeats. For manual testing, any unique string will suffice.

### HTTP/2 Benefits
While the standard SSE protocol works over HTTP/1.1, using H2C (via `h2c.sh`) allows for multiplexing and more efficient header compression, which is recommended for high-throughput streaming applications.
