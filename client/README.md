> This README was autogenerated by Junie on 2026-01-24.

The Fibonacci Client is a modern, high-performance web dashboard built with **Astro 5** and **React 19**. It provides a real-time visualization of Fibonacci calculations as they happen on the backend.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro 5](https://astro.build/) (utilizing the "Islands" architecture)
- **UI Library**: [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- **State Management**: [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) (for lightweight, framework-agnostic state)
- **Real-time Engine**: 
  - **WebSockets**: [STOMP.js](https://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/) for bi-directional communication.
  - **SSE**: Native `EventSource` API for efficient server-to-client streaming.

---

## 🎨 Features

- **Reactive Live Stream**: Watch Fibonacci numbers appear in real-time.
- **Protocol Switching**: Seamlessly toggle between **WebSockets** and **SSE** to compare performance and behavior.
- **Historical Analysis**: Search and filter through previously calculated sequences.
- **Responsive & Accessible**: Fully optimized for all screen sizes and built with accessibility in mind using DaisyUI components.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20 or later (v22 recommended)
- **npm**: v10 or later

### Installation

1. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development Workflow

Start the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

### Production Build

To generate a highly optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be located in the `dist/` directory, ready to be served by any static web server.

## 🏗 Architecture Note

This project leverages Astro's **Islands Architecture**. This means that most of the page is static HTML, while only the reactive components (like the live stream dashboard) are "hydrated" with React. This ensures lightning-fast initial load times while maintaining a rich, interactive experience.
