# 📅 Scheduler Module

The `scheduler` module provides background processing capabilities using **JobRunr**. It is responsible for executing long-running Fibonacci calculations asynchronously, ensuring the web module remains responsive.

## 🛠 Responsibilities

- **Asynchronous Execution**: Offloads heavy `BigInteger` computations to background workers.
- **Persistence Layer**: Implements the repository pattern to store calculation results in PostgreSQL.
- **Job Lifecycle**: Manages retries, monitoring, and state transitions of computation tasks.

## 🏗 Key Components

### `FibonacciComputeTask`
A `Callable` implementation that wraps the `core` module's calculation logic. It is submitted to JobRunr for background execution.

### `FibonacciRepository`
The data access object responsible for saving and retrieving `FibonacciResponse` objects. It utilizes PostgreSQL to store both the input parameters and the final result.

### `TaskConfig`
Configures the JobRunr storage provider (Postgres) and the background job server. It also defines the JSON mapper used for serializing task data.

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. The **Web Module** receives a request and schedules a job via the `JobScheduler`.
2. **JobRunr** persists the task to the database.
3. A **Background Worker** picks up the task and executes the `FibonacciComputeTask`.
4. The result is saved back to the database via `FibonacciRepository`.
5. (Optional) A database **Trigger** or **NOTIFY** event is fired, which the Web Module listens for to push updates to the client.
