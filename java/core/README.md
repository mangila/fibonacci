The `core` module is a zero-dependency, pure Java library providing high-performance Fibonacci calculation algorithms. It is designed to be lightweight and easily integrated into any Java environment.

## 🧬 Supported Algorithms

We implement three distinct calculation strategies, each with different performance characteristics:

### 1. Fast Doubling
- **Complexity**: $O(\log n)$
- **Implementation**: Uses the matrix exponentiation identity to calculate $F_n$ in logarithmic time.
- **Best for**: Very large indices where $O(n)$ would be too slow.

### 2. Iterative
- **Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Implementation**: Standard bottom-up dynamic programming approach.
- **Best for**: Small to medium-sized indices.

### 3. Recursive (Naive)
- **Complexity**: $O(2^n)$
- **Implementation**: Standard top-down recursion.
- **Caution**: Only suitable for very small $n$ (e.g., $n < 40$) as execution time grows exponentially.

## 🛠 Usage

The primary entry point is the `FibonacciCalculator`. All algorithms return `BigInteger` to handle the rapid growth of the sequence.

```java
import com.github.mangila.fibonacci.core.FibonacciCalculator;
import java.math.BigInteger;

// Using the optimized Fast Doubling algorithm
BigInteger result = FibonacciCalculator.fastDoubling(1000);

// Using the Iterative algorithm
BigInteger result2 = FibonacciCalculator.iterative(50);
```

## 🏗 Package Structure

- `com.github.mangila.fibonacci.core`: Contains the `FibonacciCalculator` and the `FibonacciAlgorithm` strategy enum.
- `com.github.mangila.fibonacci.core.entity`: Data transfer objects (`FibonacciRequest`, `FibonacciResponse`) for consistency across modules.
