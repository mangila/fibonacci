# ☕ Fibonacci Java Backend

> [!NOTE]

The backend is a high-performance Maven multi-module project powered by **Java 25** and **Spring Boot 4**. It is architected to handle asynchronous computation of large Fibonacci sequences and stream the results in real-time.

## 🏗 Module Architecture

The project is split into three specialized modules to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

- **[`core`](./core)**: 
    - Pure Java implementation of Fibonacci algorithms.
    - Zero external dependencies (no Spring).
    - Contains logic for Iterative, Recursive, and Fast Doubling approaches.
- **[`scheduler`](./scheduler)**: 
    - Manages background job execution using **JobRunr**.
    - Handles database persistence for calculation results.
    - Acts as the bridge between the computation logic and the data store.
- **[`web`](./web)**: 
    - The Spring Boot application entry point.
    - Provides REST endpoints for triggering calculations.
    - Implements **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** and **WebSockets (STOMP)** for real-time delivery.
    - Manages PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY` for reactive updates.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 25**: Required for Virtual Threads and modern language features.
- **Maven 3.9+**: For building the project.
- **PostgreSQL**: Accessible via Docker or local installation.

### Building the Project

Run the following command from the `java` directory to build all modules and run tests:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### Running the Application

To start the main web server:

```bash
./mvnw -pl web spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can run the fat JAR:

```bash
java -jar web/target/web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## 🛠 Advanced Features

- **Virtual Threads (Loom)**: The application is configured to use Virtual Threads for handling blocking I/O operations, ensuring high scalability.
- **Database Migrations**: Database schema is managed via **Flyway**, ensuring consistent environments.
- **Real-time Engine**: Uses a combination of PostgreSQL notifications and Spring's messaging infrastructure to push updates to clients with minimal latency.
- **Observability**: Built-in health checks and metrics via Spring Boot Actuator.

## 🧪 Testing

We employ a comprehensive testing strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: For core algorithm verification.
- **Integration Tests**: Using **Testcontainers** to verify database and scheduler interactions.

Run all tests:
```bash
./mvnw test
```
